    - `[AppScopeIds <String[]>]`: Ids of the app specific scopes when the assignment scopes are app specific. The scopes of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. Directory scopes are shared scopes stored in the directory that are understood by multiple applications. Use / for tenant-wide scope. App scopes are scopes that are defined and understood by this application only.
    - `[AppScopes <IMicrosoftGraphAppScope[]>]`: Read-only collection with details of the app specific scopes when the assignment scopes are app specific. Containment entity. Read-only.
      - `[Id <String>]`: Read-only.
      - `[DisplayName <String>]`: Provides the display name of the app-specific resource represented by the app scope. Provided for display purposes since appScopeId is often an immutable, non-human-readable id. Read-only.
